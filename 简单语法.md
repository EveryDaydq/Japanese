```

表示这层含义时，其疑问句和否定句有两种形式：

- 把`have`作为一般动词，否定句和疑问句通过`do`,`does`来体现,只要不是第三人称单数就使用`do` （美）

```
Do you have a borther?
I don't have a brother.

He has a car.
Does he have a car? // 加了does后面助动词要使用原型
He dosen't have a car.

Do you have any honey?
I don't have a honey, but I have some Jam.

Do the chiren have a butter?
They don't have nay butter.but they have some eggs.
```

- 把`have`作为助动词，即提至主语前变为疑问句，之后加`not`变为否定句。(英)

```
Have you a brother?
I haven't a brother.

Has he a car?
He hasn't a car.
```

> have表示“患病”

```
Jimmy has a bad cold.

Does he have a bad cold?
