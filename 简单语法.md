What(+名词)+助动词+主语？
```

What color is your car?
```

陈述句变特殊疑问句：
1. 根据意思确定特殊疑问词

What color is your hair?

Elaine is our teacher.
Who is Elaine?

	a quarter to eleven // 十点四十五

美式简单表达方法：
**小时 + 分钟**
one twenty // 一点二十

one fifty five // 一点五十五	

## have的用法

> `have`基本的意思为“拥有”，“具有”，第三人称单数`has`


```
I have a sister and a brother.
He has a car.
```

表示这层含义时，其疑问句和否定句有两种形式：

- 把`have`作为一般动词，否定句和疑问句通过`do`,`does`来体现,只要不是第三人称单数就使用`do` （美）

```
Do you have a borther?
I don't have a brother.

He has a car.
Does he have a car? // 加了does后面助动词要使用原型
He dosen't have a car.

Do you have any honey?
I don't have a honey, but I have some Jam.

Do the chiren have a butter?
They don't have nay butter.but they have some eggs.
```

- 把`have`作为助动词，即提至主语前变为疑问句，之后加`not`变为否定句。(英)

```
Have you a brother?
I haven't a brother.

Has he a car?
He hasn't a car.
```

> have表示“患病”

```
Jimmy has a bad cold.

Does he have a bad cold?
Has he a bad cold?

He doesn't have a bad cold.
He hasn't a bad cold.
```
-----
```
What's the matter with Elizabeth?
Does she have an eareache? // 她耳朵痛么?
She donesn't have an eareache. // 她没有耳朵痛。
She has a headache.
```

> have可表示“吃，喝，玩，做”等常见的动作

这时have为实义动词，否定句和疑问句需要借助于助动词do的某种形式。

固定搭配：
```
have breakfast
have lunch
have dinner
have a party
have a good time
have a look
have a bath
have a walk
```

例句：
```
Do you have breakfast every day?
Did you have breakfast today?
I didn't have breakfast.
I am having breakfast.

What are they going to do?
They are going to have breakfast.

What are they doing?
They are haveing blunch.

What did they do?
They had dinner.

What is he doing?
He is having a bath.
```

注：`have`表示“拥有”和“患病”时在一般现在时态里其后可加`got`,
`got`无实际意义。这时否定句和疑问句在`have`上发生变化。

```
I've some time.
I've got some time.

Have you got any time?
I haven't got any time.
```
-----
```
Have they got any bread? // 他们有面包么？
They haven't got any bread.
```

## 语序和五种基本句式

> 五种基本句式

- S+V (主+谓)
- S+V+P (主+系动词+表)
- S+V+O (主+谓+宾)
- S+V+o+O (主+谓+间宾+直宾)
- S+V+O+C (主+谓+宾+宾补)

## 时态

英语中16种时态

即时间和形态（谓语动词的形态），不同时间所体现出来的形态不一样。英文中的时态的不同靠动词来体现。

任何时态需要掌握两条：结构和用法（即使用场合）

> 现在进行时

结构：am/is/are + doing(动词现在分词)
am/is/are 在现在进行时中为助动词(辅助动词做谓语)，没有实际意义，帮助动词doing一起做谓语。

```
I am doing...
He/She/It is doing... // (He/She/It/任何一个人名)
We/You/They are doing... // (除了I/He/She/It/任何一个人名以外的任何名称都要使用are)
```
通过`ing`体现**进行**，通过`am，is，are`体现**现在**

表示“是”时也成为系动词。

主谓一致的原则不变

动词现在分词构成：

- 一般动词在词尾加`ing`。
	read -> reading
	cook -> cooking
	climb -> climbing
- 以不发音`e`结尾的动词，去`e`再加`ing`
	make -> making
	type -> tyeing
	come -> coming
- 重读闭音节结尾的动词，双写最后一个辅音字母再加`ing`
	put -> putting
	run -> running
	begin -> beginning

音节: 一个单词内部的元音。
重读闭音节：需要看一个单词最后结尾的三个音标。如果是辅音-元音-辅音的顺序，还要第一个开始辅音右上角是重读。例如：`put[put]`,`begin[bi'gin]`


用法：
- 表示现在正在做的事
	Mon is cooking in the kitchen.
	Susan is reading a book.
	I am watching TV.
	They are cleaning the office.
	My dog is running after a cat.
- 表示现阶段正在做的事
	I am studying English.
	
否定句：在`am/is/are`	之后加`not`,缩写`n't`。例如：`He isn't sleeping.`
疑问句：把`am/is/are`提至主语前面，句末加问号。例如：`Are you reading a book?`,`What are you doing`


> 一般现在时态

时：时间，使用场合，用法
态：谓语动词的结构
表示状态：be动词
表示动作：其它动词


用法：
- 表示经常性的习惯性的动作或存在的状态
	表示状态：be动词
	表示动作：其它动词
	I often get up early. // 我常常起的很早。
	He is busy every day. // 他每天都很忙。
- 表示主语的特征，性格，能力，爱好等。
	Susan is tall.
	I like swimming.
	John works hard.- 表示客观真理。
	There are sevent days in a week.
	The earth moves around the sun.

表达过去，现在，将来都**一样**的状态就使用一般现在时态

结构：
- 主语 + 系动词be（am/is/are）
 	注意：be之后不再有其它动词，常跟形容词，名词或介词短语作表语。
	She is beautiful.
	This is my dog.
	Mom is in the kitchen.	
	否定句：在`be`后加`not`
	疑问句：把`be`提至主语前
	This isn't my dog.
	Is this your dog?
- 主语 + 其它动词
	主语 + 动词原形 // 适用于主语为第三人称单数以外的其它人称
	I love you.
	I like coffee.
	We get up at 7 in the morning. // (时间在前，地点在后)
	John and Tom like tea.
	You look well.
	否定句：主语 + `don't` + 动词原形
	疑问句：在主语前加`do`，句末用问号。
	I don't love you.
	I don't like coffee.
		Do you love me?
	Do you like coffee?
	What do you like?
	一般疑问句的回答常用`do`的简略形式。
	Yes, I do.
	No, I don't.
	注意：`be动词`与`其它动词不能`出现在同一个句子中！
- 主语 + 动词第三人称单数
	适用于：主语是三人称单数时（he/she/it）
	否定句：主语 + `doesn't` + 动词原形
	疑问句：在主语前加`does`，句末用问号。
	Does Linda like music?
	Linda doesn't like music.
	What does Linda like?
	回答：
	Yes,he does.
	Not, he doesn't.

确定：该用be动词，还是其它动词(然后决定该用原形还是三单)。	

动词第三人称单数:
- 一般在词尾加`s`
	like -> likes
	run -> runs
	live -> lives
	work -> wroks
- 辅音字母`+y`结尾的动词,把`y`变为`i`再加`es`
	cry -> cries
	fly -> flies
	study -> studies
- 以`s`,`x`,`ch`,`sh`,`o`结尾的动词，词尾加`es`
	teach -> teaches
	wash -> washes
	fix -> fixes

注意：名词两个以上时需加`s`	,`es`。动词在一般现在时态里主语为第三人称单数时需要`s`,`es`


先确定动词，然后确定主语，然后其它成分。
中文和英文不是一个字一个字对应翻译，而是意译，意思到了就可以。

```
Richard has a son.

The boy is very cute.

He has very money.
He has a lot of money.

He buys a phone every year. // 时间状语放在最后，地点状语放在最后。如果同时出现，时间在后，地点在前。
```


> 现在进行时态与一般现在时态


现在进行时态表示此刻正在进行的动作，常与`now`,`at the moment`,`today`等连用。
```

She is drinking coffee at the moment.
What are they doing today?
Thery are swimming in the river today.
What are you doing now？
I'm reading a book now.

What are you doing today?

一般现在时态表示目前一个时间段内过去，现在，将来都一样的动作或状态。常与时间频率副词`usually`,`always`,`often`,`sometimes`等连用。

```
What does she usually do in the morning?  // 时间频率副词放在谓语动词之前。
She usually drinks tea in the morning.
What do they usually do in the afternoon?
They ususlly play in the garden in the afternoon.
```

> 一般现在时态与一般过去时态

一般现在时态常与`every day`,`every week`,`sometimes`,`often`,`alway`等时间状语连用
一般过去时态常与`yesterday`,`last week`,`three days ago`等时间状语连用(只要出现了`ago`就需要使用一般过去时态)

```
She meets her firends every day.
She met her firends yesterday.

They drink some milk every day.
They drank some milk yesterday.

He swims in the river every day.
He swam in the river yesterday.

She takes him to school every morning.
She took him to school yesteryday morning.
```

> 现在完成时

结构：
`has/have` + 动词过去分词（p.p.）

完成靠动词体现，has/have现在体现
`has/have`为助动词（帮助动词一起做谓语），这边没有任何意义。
否定句和疑问句在`has/have`上发生变化。

用法：
1. 动作在**过去已经发生**，但对现在的影响依然存在，而且具体**发生时间不明**，一旦有具体发生的时间，就必须用一般过去时。

关键词**已经**
```
He has already left. // 他已经离开了。
I have already finished my work. // 我已经完成我工作了。
We have already had breakfast. // 我已经吃完早餐了
My brother has just arrived in Beijing. // 我的弟弟刚刚到达北京。
I have already had 3 cups of coffee. // 我已经喝了三倍咖啡了。
```

比较：
```
I lost my keys yesterday. // 我昨天把钥匙掉了。 // 一般过去时态

Why don't you go home? // 现在完成时
I have lost my keys.
```

现在完成时与一般过去时态的区分：
一般过去时只表示具体过去某时发生的动作，常与一下时间状语连用：`yesterday`,`last year`,`last week`,`3 days ago`,`in 1998`等
现在完成时态强调一个过去发生的动作对现在造成的**影响或结果**。常与以下时间状语连用：`just(刚刚)`,`already(已经)放在句子中间，助动词 ，实义动词之前。在陈述句中使用。`,`yet(还，仍然)放在句子末尾，在否定句或疑问句中使用`,`never(从不)`,`ever(曾经)`等。


```
I've already seen the moive.
I saw the moive on television last year.

I've already had lunch.
I had lunch at half past tewlve.

I've already cleaned my shoes.
I cleaned my shoes last night.

I've already opened the window.
I opend the window an hour ago.
```

------
```
buy - bought - bought
find - found - found
get - got - got
have - had - had
hear - heard - hread
leave - left - left
lose - lost - lost
make - made - made
meet - met - met
send - sent - sent
sweep - swept - swept
tell - told - told
```
-----
```
come - came - come
go - went - gone
speak - spoke - spoken
write - wrote - written
```

-----
```
Has he met Mrs. Jones yet?
He has already met Mes. Jones.

When did he meet Mrs. Jones?
He met Mrs. Jones last 2 week ago.

Has the boss left yet?
The boss has already left.
When did the boss leave?
The boss left ten minutes ago.
```

2. 表示一直延续到现在的动作。

这时句中常出现`for`,`since`,`so far`等词，加在时间状语前面。

`for`表示一段时间(后面跟时间段)
`since`表示从开始持续到现在（后面跟时间点）
```
I have lived in BJ for 12 year.
I have lived in BJ since 2002.
So far, we haven't seen each other.
```
----
```
I am a teacher. // 一般现在时
I was a teaher 12 years ago. // 一般过去时
I have been a tacher for 12 years. // 现在完成时

I am in BJ.
I was in BJ last year. 
I have been in BJ for12 years.
```

> 过去完成时

用法：表示动作发生在过去某时之前，即一定强调“过去的过去”


过去完成时的构成

肯定句：`S. + had + done` // 主语 + had + 动词过去分词
否定句: `S. + had not/hadn't + done`
疑问句: `had + S. + done`

`when`,`before`,`after`连词连接主从句子:
```
When the police arrived,the thief had away. // 当警察到达，小偷已经逃走了。 (一般过去 + 过去完成)
The classs had begun when Bob arrived.
They had left before I came back. // 在我回来之前他们已经离开了。
The rain had stopped before I got home.
Where had you been before the class began?
I went to the dentist after I had made an appointment.
The boss left the office after he had finshed work.
// 我做完家务就出去了
I went out after I had finished the housework.
```

> 过去进行时

用法：表示过去某时刻或某个阶段正在进行的动作。
结构：`was/were + doing`

```
She was swimming yesterday afternoon.
I was sleeping at 10 last night.
We were having coffee yesterday afternoon.
He was singing in the bathroom.
```
过去进行时尤用于`when`，`as`，`while`引导的时间状语从句中，用来说明主动动作发生时的背景。

当，正在。
```
When I was cooking, he called. // 过去进行时，一般过去时
When he was crossing the street,he slipt.
The phone rang when I was washing the dishes.
The train left when I was buying the ticke. // 当我正在买票的时候火车开走了
While we were having dinner, the doorbell rang.
```
否定句和疑问句在`was/were`上发生变化。
```
You were not listening to me.
Were you listening to me?
What were you dong When I called you?
```

> 一般将来时

用法：表示从现在看将来要发生的动作。
常与将来的时间状语连用，如`tomorrow`,`next week`，明年，下个月等。
结构：`will/shall` + 动词原型
- `shall`只用于第一人称(I,we).
- 其它人称不用`shall`,任何人称都可以使用`will`

`will`可用于任何人称，常和主语缩写为`'ll`，否定缩写`won't`.
`will/shall`为情态动词，不随主语的改变而改变。其后必须用动词原形。

```
I'll leave Beijing tomorrow. // 明天离开北京。
It'll snow tonight. // 今天晚上会下雪。
It won't snow tonight. // 今天晚上不会下雪。
Will you miss me? // 你会想我吗？
I was,am and will be your frined. // 我过去是，现在是，过去是你好朋友。
```

一般将来和一般过去结合起来
```
It snowed yestreday, and it will sonw tomorrow.
He got up late yeserday, and he will get up late tomorrow.
He arrived late yesterday and he will arrived late tomorrow.
```

> 过去将来时态

用法：表示从过去看将要发生的动作。
结构：`would` + 动词原形

```
He said he wouldn't come tomorrow. // 他说他明天不来了
```

## be going to do

- 表示“计划，打算做某事”，是将来时态的一种体现形式。(用现在进行时表达将来)
- be为助动词，随着主语的变化而变化，即：`am`，`is`，`are`
	I am going to...
	He/She/It is going to...
	We/They/You are going to...
- to后一定用动词原形 (to + 动词原型，动词不定式）
- 否定疑问句在`be`上发生变化

```
I am going to cook. // 我打算做饭。
Susan is going to write a letter.
What are you going to do? // 你打算做什么？
I am not going to cooke toninght. // 我今天晚上不打算做饭。
What is Emma going to do?
She is going to wash the dished. // 她打算洗碗。

What is Linda going to do?
She is going to watch TV.

I am going to watch movie.
```

## 情态动词

常见的情态动词有：
`can(能够)`,`may(可以)`,`must(必须)`,`will(将要)`等
助动词：帮助别的动词一起做谓语。

- 情态动词具有实际意义的助动词。
- 情态动词不能单独做谓语，需要和动词原形一起做谓语。
- 情态动词没有人称的变化。
- 含有情态动词的句子，疑问句否定句要在情态动词上发生变化。

```
I can swim.
Can you swim?
I can not swim. // I can't swim.
Can you type this letter?
I can type this letter.
Can the cat drink its milk?
It can drink its milk.
```

## 不定代词

不一定代替那个代词

```
every每一个         			no没有 			          any任何一个           some某一个
everyone每一个人          no one没有人          anyone任何人 					someone某个人
everybody每一个人         nobody没有人					anybody任何人         somebody某个人
everything每一件事件/东西 nothing没有东西/时间  anything任何事情/东西 something某件事情/东西
everywhere每一个地点  		nowhere没有地方				angwhere任何地方	    somewhere某个地点
```

注意事项：
- `some`打头的词用于肯定句，`any`打头的词用于否定句和疑问句。
- 不定代词做主语，谓语动词用单数。

```
Is there anything in the water? // 水里有东西么？
There is something in the water. // 水里有东西。
There isn't anything in the water. // 水里没有东西。
There is nothing in the water. // 水里没有东西。

There isn't angone in the office. // 办公室一个人也没有。
There is no one in the offcie. // 办公室一个人也没有。
Everyone is present. // 每一个人都到场了。
```

## 反意疑问句

反着的意思在询问

反意疑问句由两部分组成：前一部分为陈述句，后一部分为简短问句，两部分有逗号隔开。
陈述句若是肯定句则问句用否定形式，陈述句若是否定句则问句用肯定形式。即：前肯后否前否后肯。

注意：
- 问句主语需与主句主语一致，且问句用代词不用名词。
- 前后助动词，时态须保持一致。

```
He won't be late, will he? // 他不会迟到的，不是吗？
You are tired, aren't you? // 他累了，不是吗？
It isn't going to rain tomorrow, is it?
He went out, didn't he? // 他出去了，不是吗？
You love me，don't you? // 你爱我，对不对？
He doesn't fell ill, does he? // 他没有生病，对不对?
You can wait for me, can't you?
There is no water here, is there?
He hasn't left yet, has he?
You have been here for a long time, haven't you?


There are few people left, are there? // few 当作否定词,修饰可数名词 // 剩下的人几乎没有了。
There is little wine left, is there? // little当作否定词，修饰不可数名词。 // 剩下的酒不多了，是么？
```

## 形容词和副词比较级最高级

英文中大多数形容词副词有三种形式：原级，比较级(更...)，最高级(最...)。

比较级：两者进行比较时用比较级。
最高级：三者或三者以上进行比较时用最高级。

> 比较级最高级构成

- 一allest般情况词尾加`er`构成比较级，加`est`构成最高级
	tall -> taller -> tallest // 高的
	hrad -> harder -> hardest // 坚硬的
	great -> greater -> greatest
- 以`e`结尾的词直接加`r`,`st`
	large -> larger -> largest
	nice -> nicer -> nicest
- 以辅音字母加`y`结尾的词，把`y`变为`i`再加`er`,`est`
	happy -> happier -> happiest
	esay -> easier -> easiest
- 重读闭音节(辅元辅)结尾的词双写最后一个辅音字母再加`er`,`est`
	hot -> hotter -> hottest
	big -> bigger -> biggest

> 比较级最高级用法

比较级：

构成：比较级 + `than...`
若比较的东西比较明显，`than`之后可以省去

```
Mary is taller than Susan.
My hair is longer than yours. // 前后事物必须保持一致,通过代词来表示前面的头发。
This coat is prettier. // 这件外套更漂亮
Today is warmer. // Today is warmer than is yesterday.
```

最高级：

最高级用于三者以上的比较
结构：`the` + 最高级（+比较范围）
比较范围往往是介词短语或从句（如`of all`,`in the world`,`in the class`,`I have ever seen`）

翻译：先要说最重要的部分。（一句话最核心的主语，谓语部分）
最重要的在句子首部。
```
She is the tallest in the class。
He is the tallest I have ever seen.
This apple is the sweetest I have ever eaten.
```
-----
```
This question is easier than that one. // 这个问题比那个问题容易。
It's the easiest of them all. // 这是最简单的。
This knife is sharper than that one.
It's the sharpeset of them all.
She is pertitier than her sister.
She is the prettiest I have ever seen.
```

多音节词（通常两个音节以上）比较级最高级分别为：
音节：元音音标的个数

比较级：`more` + 原级
最高级：`most` + 原级

```
beautiful -> more beautiful -> most beautiful
expensive - more expensive -> most expensive //  昂贵
famouse -> more famouse -> mast famouse
```
-----
```
This car is beautiful.
That one is more beautiful.
It's the most beautiful one I have ever seen.
```

注：双音节以辅音字母加`y`结尾的词比较特殊，最高级仍把`y`变为`i`再加`er/est`.
```
busy -> busier -> busiest
```
特殊的形容词副词的比较级最高级：
```
good/well -> better -> best // 好的
bad/ill -> worse -> worst // bad坏的，ill坏的，生病的
many/much - more -> most // many修饰可数名词，must修饰不可数名词。 多
little -> less -> least // 少
```
若表示比原来少不管单音节词多音节词都在原级前加`less`变比较级，加`least`变最高级

```
Susan is tall.
I am less tall.
I am the least tall in the class.

This movie is interesting.
That one is less interesting.
```

> 不出现比较级的比较

表达比较，但是不出现比较词。

```
A is as + 原级 + as B // A和B一样。
A is not so/as + 原级 + as B // A不如B
```
----
```
I am as tall as Susan.
I am not so tall as Susan.
This book is as good as that one.
I run as fast as Liu Xiang.
// Do动词原行 Did动词的过去 Dose动词的三单
I don't run so fast as Liu Xiang.
```
在没有助动词却要补上去的时候：
Do动词原行 Did动词的过去 Dose动词的三单

## 被动语态

> 被动语态概述

`被...`

语态是动词的一种形式，用以表达主语和谓语之间的关系。

语态分两种：主动语态和被动语态。

主动语态：表示主语是谓语动词的执行者。
被动语态：表示主语是谓语动词的承受者。

被动语态用于不知道动作的执行者是谁或根本没必要说明动作的执行者是谁。

谓语动词：`be + 过去分词`

过去分词表达：
1. 完成
2. 被动

不同时态体现在`be`形式不同

> 被动语态时态

一般现在时被动语态结构：
`am/is/are` + 动词过去分词

一般过去时态被动语态结构：
`was/were` +  动词过去分词


```
My car is cleaned every week. // 我的车每周被清洗。
Our cars are cleaned every week. // 我们的车被清洗。
The houres was built 100 years ago. // 房子在100前建造。
The office is cleaned every day. // 这间办公司每天都被打扫。
The offices are cleaned every day. // 这些办公室每天被打扫。
The office was cleaned yesterday.
```

现在完成时态被动语态结构：
`has/have been` + 动词过去分词

一般将来时态被动语态结构：
`will be` + 动词过去分词

```
My car has benn repaired. // 我的车修好了。
These cars have been repaired.
His key has just been stolen. // 他的钥匙刚刚被偷了。
The room has been cleaned.

The thief will be caught soon. // 这些贼将来会被抓住。
```

> 被动语态——主动变被动

主语 + 谓语 + 宾语 （主动语态） -> 宾语 + be + 过去分词 + （by + 主语） （被动语态）
```
I clean my car every week. -> My car is cleaned (by me) every week.
They built the house 100 years ago. -> The house was built (by them) 100 years ago.
They have found the boy. -> The boy has been found(by them).
```

> 被动语态——八种时态

一般现在：`as/is/are + done`
一般过去: `was/were + done`

现在进行: `am/is/are + being + done`
过去进行: `was/were + being + done`

现在完成: `has/have + been + done`
过去完成: `had + been + done`

一般将来: `will + be + done`
过去将来：`would + be + done`
